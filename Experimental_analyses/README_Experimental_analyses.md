# Experimental analyses
In this repository folder we provide code to reproduce the statistical analyses and figures of main and supplement parts of our manuscript. The running time of all scripts is less than 5min, unless explicitly stated below.
The libraries used and their versions are appended as a comment at the end of each script. The code is organized into the folders with one or few scripts:

## aux
* Contains code used in several scripts

## behaviour aggregated
* Analyses with respect to the difference between mean behavior after-treatment and before-treatment, for selfgrooming (Fig 1b), performed allogrooming (Fig 1c), received allogrooming (Fig 1d), and poison uptake behavior (Suppl Fig 2), grouped by individual treatment.

## grooming_bias
* Analyses the grooming bias nestmates towards the higher-load ant  (Fig 2c), whilst the duration per grooming bout does not change with load or in time (Fig 2d).

## nestmate_selfgrooming
* Nestmate selfgrooming after having performed grooming of or having received grooming by another individual, in dependence of the treatment of the partner ant (Suppl Fig 3).  

## spores_acquired_by_grooming
* Shows how the number of spores retrieved from the head of the ants reflect previous grooming, in particular that the presence/absence of spores is predicted by the duration of grooming performed (Suppl Fig 4a), and that the number of spores is correlated to grooming performed at different time intervals (Suppl Fig 4b).

## pellets
* Analyses of the number of pellets per group (Suppl Fig 5a) and grooming time before pellet expulsion in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd 30 min period after treatment (Suppl Fig 5b) .

## log_odds_ratio_to_groom
Computes the log odds to groom a higher loaded individual given the spore load difference, of the current spore load (Fig 6a and Suppl Fig 9), and the initial spore load (Suppl Fig 7).
