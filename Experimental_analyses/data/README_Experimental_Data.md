# This 'Experimental_data' folder contains the basic data for use in the 'Experimental_Analysis' code provided under GitHub: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

## File names represent the naming scheme resulting from the code provided in the 'Preparation' folder in the same GitHub. Data files can be directly read into by the scripts in the 'Experimental_Analysis'.

### The files contain the behavioral annotation data per video for all the 99 replicates (used as basis for all behavioral analyses), as well as the data files used for read-in to directly reproduce our statistical analyses and plots for Figs. 1b,c,d; 2c,d, 6a and Suppl. Figs. 2,3,4,5,7,9.

#### Note that the 'source_data' to all (experiment-derived) figures in the publication can be found directly on the journal's web page linked to the publication. Note that original labels in the datasets contain 'H' for high fungal load and 'L' for low fungal load, which are presented by 'F' (for H) and 'f' (for L) in the publication. In the basic data files, the control treatment group ('C' in the publication) is referred to either directly as 'C', or as 'Tx' or 'T', given that it consisted of a sham treatment of Triton X, as specified in each analysis file. The untreated nestmates are consistently labelled by 'N' throughout.

##### In the basic data files, we refer to the original dish number of the 18 replicates each of the 6 treatment groups 'HH','HL','HTx','LL','LTx','TxTx'. Since 9 of these dishes could not be analysed due to technical errors (HH 11, HL 6, HL 11, LL 11, LL 16, HTx 11, HTx 18, LTx 6, TxTx 16), our publication is based on the remaining set of the analysable16-17 replicates per treatment group, i.e. total 99 replicates (see Suppl. Table 1). The file 'labeling.csv' provides the details between final replicate number based on the FfCnomenclature shown in the source data and the original nomenclature HLT(respTx,C).
