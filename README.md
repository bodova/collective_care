 **Dynamic pathogen detection and social feedback shape collective hygiene in ants**


1. [Data preparation](#preparation)
2. [Experimental data analyses](#analyses)
3. [Modeling and simulations](#modeling) 

## 1. Data preparation  <a name="preparation"></a>
Scripts (Python) to take raw output from behavioral annotation software (Solomon coder version 17.0 by András Péter) and  experiment-associated data produce analysis-ready data tables. A sample set is included to reproduces all preparation steps. Additional guidance and details on how to prepare the pipeline on this directory's README file.

## 2. Experimental analyses  <a name="analyses"></a>
Scripts (R) for the statistical analysis of the experimental data.
The datasets needed to run these scripts are provided under the ISTA repository https://research-explorer.ista.ac.at/ via https://doi.org/10.15479/AT:ISTA:12945
In addition, all source data for the experimental part of the study are provided directly with the publication on the journal's web page.  

## 3. Modeling and simulations  <a name="modeling"></a>
Scripts (Matlab) and sample data to:
1. Backcompute the current spore load from grooming activity and spore loads measured at the end of the experiment
2. Infer from data and simulate collective sanitary care of ants in the presence of a pathogen
3. Simulate a simpler exploration-exploitation model for various group sizes
Additional guidance and details on this directory's README file.
